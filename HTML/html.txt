    link colors -

                        }
                     </style>

    bookmark in html - useful when webpage is very long
        - <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
        - first create bookmark - <h2 id="C4">Chapter-4</h2>
        - then use <a href="#C4">Chapter-4</a> to link to that particular section of the page
        - <a href="#C4">Chapter-4</a> - this is called anchor

HTML IMAGES - helps to improve the design and apprearance of the webpages 
						- <img src="image.jpg" alt="image" width="500" height="500">
						- src - source of the image
						- alt - alternative text - if image is not available then this text will be displayed
						- width and height - size of the image(should use style method instead as it prevents any change due to  embedded or internal stylesheet)
						- to point to image on other server use absolute url
						- to point to image on same server use relative url
						- to point to image on same server but in different folder use relative url with folder name
						- can put animated gifs alsousing the same command
						- image floating - refers to alignment and wrapping of image with respect to text (<img src="image.gif" alt="image" style="flaot:right">)
		Image Maps - allows you to create clickable areas in image
			      - defined by <map>
						- <area> tag defines the clickable area as well as its shape
						- main idea - to perform different action upon clicking different part of the image
						- eg - <img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">

									<map name="workmap">
										<area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
										<area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="phone.htm">
										<area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Coffee" href="coffee.htm">
									</map>
						- the usemap value starts with "#" followed by the name of the map
						- here the shape attribute represents the shape of the object being marked (rect - rectangle,circle - circle,poly - polygon,default - entire region)
						- coords - coordinates of the shape
						         - in rect, coords are the extreme points of the diagonal
										 - in circle, coords are the center and radius of the circle
										 - in polygon, coords are the points of the polygon(different points on the shape are selected and straightline contianing joining them forms the desired shape)
						- image map and js - 
						         - clickable area can also trigger some js function
										 - eg - <map name="workmap">
										 					<area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.png" onclick="func()">
														</map>
														<script>
															function func(){
																alert("hello");
															}
														</script>
		Image Background - used to set image as background on element and entire page
		        - on element - use <style> and add css property "background-image" to it(eg - <p style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');">)
												 - can also specify the element in <style> inside <head>(<style>
																																									p {
																																										background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
																																									}
																																									</style>)
						- on entire page - specify the same in <body> 
												 - eg - <style>
																body {
																	background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
																}
																</style>
						- background repeat - by default, if the size of image is smaller than the size of the element thent he image will repeat itself until it covers the entire element
												 - to prevent this, use "background-repeat" property in css and put its value to "no repeat"
												 - if you want tot cover element fully with the image and maintain the aspect ratio of the image - set background-size property to "cover"
												 - if you want to make sure entire element is always covered with image - set background-attachment to "fixed"
												 - if you want to strech the image to fully cover the element - set background-size property to "100%100%"
						- <picture> element - allows youto specify different images for different screen sizes
						             - it gives developer more flexibility in specifying resources
												 - contains one or more <source> element (each specifying to different images through "srcset")
												 - this source element allows browser to select the most appropriate image according to the current view or device
												 - souce also contains a "media" attribute that defines when this source image is to be choosen for display
												 - contains one <img> element just before closing the </picture> to add default behaviour when either none of the source works
												 - eg - <picture>
																	<source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img_food.jpg">
																	<source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img_car.jpg">
																	<img src="img_girl.jpg">
																</picture>
												 - when to use - 
												 			- bandwidth - when using smal scren its unneccessary to load large image
																					- browser will use the first source with the matching attribute value
															- format support - allow to specify any format that the browser can support

HTML FAVICON - refers to the small image displayed next to the title int he titlebar of the browser
						- typically the website logo
						- can be added in 2 ways
												- using <link> element in <head>(eg - <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">)
												- using <meta> element in <head>(eg - <meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#da532c">)
						- favicon can be create at - www.favicon.cc 
						- can be either saved in the root directory or in images forled in root directory
						- can be of any format - .ico, .png, .gif, .jpg
						- can be of any size - but recommended size is 16x16 pixels

HTML PAGE TITLE - every webpage should have a title that describe the meaning of the webpage
						- can be added using <title> element in <head>
						- can be used to set the title of the tab or page in the browser
						- shown in web browsers title bar
						- importance - 
												1. important for search engine optimization(SEO)[i.e. its text is used by search engine algo to decide the order when listing the pages in search result]
												2. used by browser to display the title of the page in the tab
												3. provides title for the page when added to favourites
						- must be accurate and meaningful

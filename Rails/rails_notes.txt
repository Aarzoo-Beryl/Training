RUBY ON RAILS - 
	- open source web application framework
	- written in RUBY
	- created in 2003 by DAVID HEINEMEIER HANSSON ['DHH']
	- released as open source in 2004


RAILS - 
	- set of web framework 
	  [framework => prewritten code and libraries that developer can use to handle common tasks and solve 
	  re-occuring problems]

	- follows DRY code (Don't repeat yourself)
	  [idea - every peice of information should be written only once and can be refered where ever needed]
	  [pros - concise,consistant and easily maintainable code]

	- follows Convention Over Configuration
	  [idea - rather than configuring again and again ,use pre configured functions with default setting for 
	  general purpose and if some specification neede the perconfigured function can be overwritten according 
	  to the preference]
	  [pros - speed up development process]
	
	- most coding done in app folder, config used to describe configurations like routes,database,etc.


MVC ARCHITECTURE - 
	- M - MODEL [refers to the data objects we use in the application]
	  V - VIEW [refers to presentation layer, how data is presented to the user]
	  C - CONTROLLER [processes and responds to user's events]

	- Basic Web Architecture 
	 	[BROWSER] <=> [PAGE] <=> [DATABASE]

	- MVC Web Architecture
		[BROWSER] <=> [CONTROLLER] <=> [MODEL] <=> [DATABASE]
		       ^\     /.
			     [VIEW]
		 - browser sends info to controller which fetched info from database through model
		 - once info recieved , the indo is sent to view by controller and is then finally displayed on browser

		 - here contoller (handles decisions) , model (handles data) , view (handles presentation)
		 - in RAILS , code library for controller -> ActionController , model -> ActiveRecord , view -> ActionView
		   [controller and view can be packed, as they are very related, into -> ActionPack]
	
INSTALLATION - 

	- $curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io -o rvm.sh
	- $less /tmp/rvm.sh
	- $cat /tmp/rvm.sh | bash -s stable --rails
	- $source /home/sammy/.rvm/scripts/rvm

NEW PROJECT - 

	- $rails new <project_name> -d <database_name>
	  [if run bundle install not working, open the project_name directory
		do - 
		$gem install pg
		$gem update --system
		$gem update bundler
		$bundle install			]

OPENING BROWSER - 

	- $rails server [or] $ rails s
	  [creates server]

CREATING BASIC DATABASE - 

	- $rails db:create
	  [creates necessary database]

GENEREATING CONTROLLER - 

	- $rails generate [or] $rails g
	  [tells us what all it can generate]

	- $rails generate controller
	  [asks us to provide more details and also provides us with options available]

	- $rails generate controller Demo index
	  [generate controller Demo and view index]
	  ['index' is basically a function/method that controller would perform and when put inside controller class it is called an action that controller will perform]
	
SERVER REQUEST HANDELING - 

	- Actual ROR Architecture - 
											(RAILS FRAMEWORK)		
		[BROWSER]<=>[WEB SERVER]<=>[PUBLIC]=>[ROUTER]
						^						|.
						|					[CONTROLLER]
						|				       |.    |.
						-------------------[VIEWS] [MODELS]<=>[DATABASE]

	- Newly added items - ROUTER and PUBLIC
	- the files in public directory can be directly accessed by anyone

ROUTES - 

	- when web server can't find the requested file in the public directory,then sends rewuest to routing portion of the framework,which further
	  examines what conroller and action to be called (done by using definitions of route.rb file present in config folder)
	- main point of rounting - to identify how a url string works

	- ROUTES TYPES - 
			- SIMPLE MATCH ROUTE - 
				- get 'demo/index'
				  [simply matches the controller and the action][mostly used]
			- DEFAULT MATCH ROUTE - 
				- basic structure - :controller/:action/:id
				- example - get ':controller(/:action(/:id))
				  [they act as variable name and help match pattern]
			- ROOT MATCH ROUTE - 
				- purpose - routes request to the controller when no controller or action is specified 
				- acts as a home page
				- syntax - root 'demo#index'
		
RENDER A TEMPLATE - 

	- (examining how controller and view works,and how can we add dynamic content to it)
	- essential part of Architecture includes browser,controller and view

	- request-respond loop main parts include route,controller action and view template

	- Render template syntax - 
			- controller primarily picks the template by matching the current controller and message by default 
			- to do it manualy 'render' command is used inside current controller 
				   render (:template => 'demo/hello')
			  [or] render ('demo/hello')
			  [or] render ('hello')  [used if to be done inside current controller]
			- main purpose - to define what view to open when a certain url is requested 

REDIRECT ACTIONS - 
	- controller can respond to the rendering view but can also send them to another controller/action
	  (i.e. when requesting some url the controller has capability to redirect it to some other controller ot action)
	- example - for some user's request, we first need to check if he/she has logged in or not , then we can design it such way that when user's request is processed ,
				it opens login page first.(we want the url to change)
	
	- HTTP Redirect -
			- when we redirect ,rails put status code to browser[when browser recieves request got the mentioned url, it goes back to route to identify what to view]
	- Rails Redirect - 
			- syntax - 
					     redirect_to(:controller=>'demo',:action=>'index')
					[or] redirect_to(controller:'demo',action:'index')
					[or] redirect_to (action:'index') [if redirecting in same directory]
			- it can redirect to anywhere, location not limited to the currect application

VIEW TEMPLATES - 

	- ERB - Embeded Ruby 
		- it is a template system to embed Ruby
		- in file name hello.html.erb , the file is processed with erb and output format is html
		- correct erb tag is to be used in order to tell ruby what it should put in code
		- syntax - <% code %>
			  [or] <%= code%>   [= prints output of the code , here puts and print doesn't work]
		- example - <% 3.times do |n| %>
					<p><%= n %></p>
					<% end %>

INSTANCE VARIABLE - 

	- primary responsibility of controller is to gather data from model and database, and make it available for view templaate to view it on browser
	- controller sets everything ahead of time so that view can focus on presentation only
	- to pass data from controllerto view , we use 'instance variables'
	- these instance variable have scope throughout the instance of the ruby class[once called can be accessed from other methods of the same class]
	  [here object is instance od controller class]
	- syntax - @variable
	- when ruby randers a template it gathers up all instance variables and make them available for the template[regular will not be available]

LINKS - 

	- basic syntax - <a href = "/demo/index">Click me </a>     [html version]
	- easier syntax - <%= link_to("Click me","path") %>        [ruby version]
		[path can be written in form "/demo/index" [or] {:controller => "demo", :action => "index"} [or] {:action => "index} if same controller]
	- Working - when cliked on "Click me ", the browser sends request using the string to web server and request is passed by routes and sent 
				to correct controller and action

URL PARAMENTERS - 

	- values helping us to access a paricular part(maybe in a multipage list) 
	- if using link_to method, then can simply be put inside hash code 
	  like - {:controller=>'demo',:action=>'index',id=>20,page=4}
	  [rails convert it into url string, it helps us gather controller and action and as well as parameters so you can have easy access to them]
	- rails puts these parameters into special objects called 'params'
	  [it also puts GET(parameters from url) and POST(submitted by web forum) values in it]
	- params can be considered as a hash with come special features - 
		a value in params can be accessed either by params['id'] or params[:id]

MANAGING DATABASE TABLES - 

	three ways - 
	- using legacy database tables(i.e. using existing tables and making it interact whith ror application)
	- managing tables manualy
	- using Ruby on Rails migerations

MIGRATIONS - 

	- it is a set of database instructions written in ruby
	- helps migrate data from one state to another(staging changes made)
	- contain instruction to move "up" (to next state) or "down" (to previous state) in a database
	- ADVANTAGES - 
			- keeps database schema with application code
			- executable and repeatable
			- allow sharing schema (allow sahring migration file)
			- allow writing in ruby instead of SQL
			- able to access project code
	- GENERATING MIGRATION - 
			-$rails generate migration Migrationname [generates migration]
			-$rails generate model User first_name:string last_name:string email:string[generates model with specified column name and what data they can have]
	- RUNNING MIGRATIONS - 
			- $rails db:migrate [rails run all migerations that have not been run yet]

ACTIVE RECORD - it is a design patttern for relational database
							- helps to retrieve and manipulate data as objects and not as static rows
							- makes object intelligent [i.e. object understands database structure of a table]
							- contains data from table rows, as well as code to manipulate rows
							- object can be manipulated and saved easily
							- eg - user = User.new
										 user.first_name = "kevin"
										 user.saved																[creates SQL insert statement]
										 user.last_name = "kumar"
										 user.save																[creates SQL update statement]
										 user.destroy															[creates SQL delete statement]	
								
ACTIVE RELATION - also called "Arel"
								- object-oriented interpretation of relational algebra
								- it simplifies the generation of complex database queries(i.e. in practice, we can change small queries together,chainable, as ruby objects)
								- handles them together as complex joins and aggregation using efficient SQL
								- the queries created will not be used until needed
								- eg - users = Users.where("first_name = 'kevin'")
											 users = Users.order("last_name 'ASC'")
											 #these will not be executed until we call something upon them
											 users.each{|usr| ....}				#now as it accesses it then all the above queries will be combined and an appropriate SQL query by combining them

RAILS CONSOLE - allows to experiment with the project model in isolation[i.e. without having worry about controllers and views]
							- basic syntax - $rails console -e development		[-e helps to specify environment(development is default)]
													[or] $rails c
							- it is basically irb + our project
							- whatever we do here stays in memory unless you do (model_name.save) to save it in the actual database
			- Important - in ruby console, we are interacting with the web browser's database,any change made here will be showcased on the web browser(public data)

			- CREATE RECORD - 
							- Method_1 -> 
													Step_1 -> instantiate object [a=Subject.new]
													Step_2 -> set values 				 [a.name = 'kevin']
													Step_3 -> save 							 [a.save]
							- Method_2 -> Create 										 [a=Subject.create(:name=>'kevin')]
													#does everything in one step
							
							#if the record is saved in the database then a.new_record?==false , true otherwise

			- UPDATE RECORD - 
							- Method_1 -> 
													Step_1 -> find object 				[a=Subject.find(1)]
													Step_2 -> update values 			[a.name = 'kumar']
													Step_3 -> save 							  [a.save]
							- Method_2 ->
													Step_1 -> find object 				[a=Subject.find(1)]
													Step_2 -> set values and save [a.update(:name=>"kumar")]

			- DELETE RECORD - 
							- Method -> 
													Step_1 -> find object 				[a=Subject.find(1)]
													Step_2 -> destroy							[a.destroy]
								#here destroy should be prefered over delete , as destroy removes the row from datatbase and freezes it but it will still be available for the inspection

			- FIND RECORD - 
							- Method_1 -> Primary key finding
													syntax -> Subject.find(1)				{1 is the primary key ,id}
													#return orbject if present, error otherwise
							- Method_2 -> Conditions
													syntax -> Subject.where(:visible=>true)			{allows to mention conditions}
													syntax -> Subject.where("name='kumar' AND position=1")
											Warning -> we never interpolate ,like Users.where("first_name LIKE #{@query}"), directly into the string because interpolating string might be corrupt and can cause SQL injection
																 so rather we write it like => Users.where("first_name LIKE ?",@query) {in this ruby first sanitizes it before putting it into the string}
											Combining conditions -> Subject.order()
																							Subject.limit()
																							Subject.offset()
														eg - Subject.where(:visible=>true).order('position ASC')

			- ONE-TO-MANY -> 
													Step_1 -> create relationship in database making sure it contains foreign key
													Step_2 -> define relationshipin models,both sides
													Step_3 -> use relationships
							- Defining Methods ->
											Eg-> (in module)
														class Subject
																has_many :pages
														end
														class Pages
																belongs_to :pages
														end
											[rails automatically invokes after definning relationship]
											
						  - Practical ->
													> a=Subject.find(1) 											[finds subject with id =1]
													> a.pages																	[checks for pages with same subject id as a]
													> b = Page.new(:name=>'first_page')				[creates new page object]
													> a.page << b															[sets a's page id as b's subject_id]
													> a.pages																	[results b]

CRUD - refers to Create Read Update Delete 
		 - web application performs these basic CRUD operations on the database -
					CRUD 			ACTION 				Example URL
					Create 		new 					/subjects/new
					Create 		create				/subjects/create
					Read				index					/subjects
					Read				show 					/subject/show/:id
					Update			edit 					/subject/edit/:id
					Update			update 				/subject/update/:id
					Delete			delete 				/subject/delete/:id
					Delete			destroy 			/subject/destroy/:id
		 - these means we need to have seperate controller for separate database
		 - CRUD allows for clear and well structured URLs

RUBY ON RAILS - 
	- open source web application framework
	- written in RUBY
	- created in 2003 by DAVID HEINEMEIER HANSSON ['DHH']
	- released as open source in 2004


RAILS - 
	- set of web framework 
	  [framework => prewritten code and libraries that developer can use to handle common tasks and solve 
	  re-occuring problems]
	- follows DRY code (Don't repeat yourself)
	  [idea - every peice of information should be written only once and can be refered where ever needed]
	  [pros - concise,consistant and easily maintainable code]
	- follows Convention Over Configuration
	  [idea - rather than configuring again and again ,use pre configured functions with default setting for 
	  general purpose and if some specification neede the perconfigured function can be overwritten according 
	  to the preference]
	  [pros - speed up development process]


MVC ARCHITECTURE - 
	- M - MODEL [refers to the data objects we use in the application]
	  V - VIEW [refers to presentation layer, how data is presented to the user]
	  C - CONTROLLER [processes and responds to user's events]

	- Basic Web Architecture 
	 	[BROWSER] <=> [PAGE] <=> [DATABASE]

	- MVC Web Architecture
		[BROWSER] <=> [CONTROLLER] <=> [MODEL] <=> [DATABASE]
		       ^\     /.
			     [VIEW]
		 - browser sends info to controller which fetched info from database through model
		 - once info recieved , the indo is sent to view by controller and is then finally displayed on browser

		 - here contoller (handles decisions) , model (handles data) , view (handles presentation)
		 - in RAILS , code library for controller -> ActionController , model -> ActiveRecord , view -> ActionView
		   [controller and view can be packed, as they are very related, into -> ActionPack]

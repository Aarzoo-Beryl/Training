------------------------------------------------------------------OPERATOR CLASS-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Setting an operator class for a column in a database essentially means specifying a set of rules or instructions that the database system should follow when
performing operations on data within that column. These operations typically include comparisons, sorting, indexing, and searching.When you set an operator class 
for a column, you're essentially telling the database "how it should handle and process the data" in that column more efficiently,based on the specific 
requirements or characteristics of the data and the operations you intend to perform on it.

For instance, consider a column containing text data. Depending on the nature of the text and the types of searches you want to perform (exact matches, partial matches, case-insensitive searches, etc.), you might choose an appropriate operator class tailored for text search operations.Similarly, if you have a column containing numerical data, you might select an operator class optimized for numerical comparisons and indexing, enabling the database to perform arithmetic operations or sort the data more efficiently.

Overall, setting an operator class for a column allows you to optimize the performance and functionality of your database system, making data operations 
faster and more effective, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Different types of operator classes cater to various data types and operations,here is a list of common operator classes and their typical usage:

1.  B-tree Operator Class: 
         -  Usage: Suitable for sorting and comparison operations on sorted data.
         -  Data Types:  Numeric, character, date, and time types.
         -  Example:  Used for indexing columns in `ORDER BY` clauses or for searching with equality operators (`=`, `>`).

2.  Hash Operator Class: 
         -  Usage:  Designed for quickly finding exact matches in large datasets.
         -  Data Types:  Typically used for equality comparisons.
         -  Example:  Useful for searching for exact matches, particularly in large tables.

3.  GiST (Generalized Search Tree) Operator Class: 
         -  Usage:  Ideal for multidimensional data types and for supporting a wide range of search operations.
         -  Data Types:  Suitable for geometric, geographic, and full-text search data types.
         -  Example:  Used in spatial databases for indexing geographic data or in text search engines for full-text indexing.

4.  GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) Operator Class: 
         -  Usage:  Optimized for full-text search and for supporting fast searches on composite data types.
         -  Data Types:  Used for full-text search, arrays, and composite types.
         -  Example:  Employed in databases for efficient text search operations, indexing arrays, and searching within JSON or other composite data           
                      structures.

5.  SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) Operator Class: 
         -  Usage:  Suitable for indexing data that can be efficiently partitioned into non-overlapping subsets.
         -  Data Types:  Often used for geometric and spatial data types.
         -  Example:  Useful for indexing spatial data, such as polygons or other complex geometric shapes.

6.  BRIN (Block Range INdex) Operator Class: 
         -  Usage:  Optimized for indexing large, sorted datasets with a low cardinality.
         -  Data Types:  Typically used for large tables with columns containing sorted, low-cardinality data.
         -  Example:  Used in time-series data, where the data is sorted by timestamp and has a limited number of distinct values.

7.  Custom Operator Class: 
         -  Usage:  Allows developers to define custom indexing strategies tailored to specific data types or application requirements.
         -  Data Types:  Customizable based on the needs of the application.
         -  Example:  Created when none of the built-in operator classes adequately meet the requirements of the data or operations.

These operator classes provide developers with the flexibility to optimize database performance for different types of data and operations. By selecting the
appropriate operator class for each column, database administrators can improve query performance, reduce resource consumption, and enhance overall system 
efficiency.

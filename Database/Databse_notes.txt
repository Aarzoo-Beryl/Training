---------------------------------------------------DATABASE------------------------------------------------------


DEFINITION - it is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a way that it can easily be accessed,managed and updated

DBMS - Database Management system
        it is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data.Its primary goal is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both efficient and convinient.
        it is used to perform CRUD operations on the database

        C- create
        R- read
        U- update
        D- delete 


ARCHITECTURE - follows a three schema architecture in order for  multiple users to access the same data at same time and to provide the user with abstract view of the data(system hides certain detail of how the datat is stored or maintained)

            Physical/internal level - describes how data is stored 
            Logical/cenceptual level - describes what data is stored and what relationship exists among them
            View/external lvel - describes the databse part that aparticular user has asked for or is intrested in
           
DATABASE LANGUAGE - 
        DDL - used to define the schema of the database
        DML - used to manipulate data(insert,delete,update,etc)

DATABASE ADMINISTRATION - person who controls both data and the programs that access those data

DATA MODELS - provides a way to describe the design of the database at the logical level.It is a collection of cenceptual tools for describing data, data reltionships,data semantics and constraints
              Eg - er model, relational model,object-oriented model, object relational dete model,etc.
   

ER MODEL - it is a high level data model based on real world perception that consists of real object called entities and relationships among them
            grapghical representation  - ER DIAGRAM which acts as blueprint of the database

ENTITY - object that has physical existance in the real world and such that each of them can be identified uniquely
            Strong Entity - can be uniquely identified
            Weak Entity - can't be uniquekt identified , depends on someother strong entity for its existance

ENTITY SET - set of entities that contain similar or common Attributes
ATTRIBUTES - an entity is represented in the form of Attributes
            can be simple(can't be decomposed further), composite(made up of several other attributes),single-valued(can have only one value),mlti-valued(has more than one value for single entity),derived(can be obtained from other attributes) and null(when an entity doesn't have value for one entity)
RELATIONSHIPS - refers to association between two or more entities
            can be strong(between two independent entities) and weak(between weak entity and its owner/strong entity)
            can be unary(where only one entity participates),binary(where two identited take part) and nary(where n no of entites take part)
RELATIONSHIP CONSTRAINTS - 
            cardinality ratio/mapping cardinality - number of entities to which another entity can be associated via a relationship(can be one to one, many to one, one to many and many to many)
            participation constrains - how well entities of different set are involved into the relationship (can be total or partial)
